## About CollectionBuilder CSV

This collection features items discovered in the pursuit of building a report for Clarence Knuckles and his family, and is built using [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv).

CollectionBuilder-CSV is a "Stand Alone" template for creating digital collection and exhibit websites using Jekyll, given:

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of images, PDFs, audio, or video files

Driven by your collection metadata, the template generates engaging visualizations to browse and explore your objects.
The resulting static site can be hosted on any basic web server.

[CollectionBuilder](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/) is an set of open source tools for creating digital collection and exhibit websites that are driven by metadata and powered by modern static web technology.
See [CB Docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/) for detailed information.
